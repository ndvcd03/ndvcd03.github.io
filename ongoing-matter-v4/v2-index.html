        <h2>project description</h2>
        <p>Ongoing Matter is a multi-platform, traveling
          collection of new poster designs that mobilizes
          political engagement. This exhibition seeks to
          encourage engagement with the Report On The
          Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016
          Presidential Election, or, as it is more
          colloquially known, the Mueller Report. These
          contemporary poster designs seek to make the Report
          accessible, and thus make the possibility of
          genuine, thoughtful, and passionate engagement with
          its findings possible. The show illuminates the
          major threats to democracy cited in the Mueller
          Report. The collection will travel to several
          venues, including the Krasl Art Center in
          St. Joseph, Michigan, as well as Cleveland State University
          Galleries in Cleveland, Ohio. This exhibition
          functions as a living showcase of
          current political artefacts that seeks to empower
          citizens at a crucial moment in the democratic
          experience (pre-2020 presidential elections). As
          graphic designers, the artists in this exhibition
          consider their charge one of emancipation: using
          the art of communication to reveal, persuade, and
          propel action. It should be noted that this project
          is non-partisan; even if the audience that
          experience this work has varied ideologies, the
          ultimate goal is to energize citizens to
          participate in their own democracy. Ongoing Matter
          is concerned with preserving democracy, protecting
          integrity, and sharing knowledge.</p>
